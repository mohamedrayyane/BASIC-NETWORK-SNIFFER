# BASIC-NETWORK-SNIFFER
As part of my internship journey, I developed a simple but effective Network Packet Sniffer using Python and Scapy.
# 🐍 Network Packet Sniffer (Python + Scapy)

## 🔎 Description

A simple network packet sniffer developed as part of my cybersecurity internship. This project captures and analyzes network packets to better understand how protocols work and how traffic flows inside a network.

## 🚀 Features

- Capture live packets from the network interface
- Analyze and display:
  - Source and Destination IP addresses
  - Protocol (TCP, UDP, ICMP)
  - Ports for TCP and UDP traffic
- Easy to extend and customize

## 🛠 Tools Used

- Python 3
- Scapy (Python library for packet manipulation)

## 💻 How to Run

```bash
sudo python3 sniffer.py
